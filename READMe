A  machine learning analysis comparing classification algorithms for predicting term deposit subscriptions in bank marketing campaigns.

Project Overview

This project analyzes a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) to predict which clients are most likely to subscribe to term deposits. 
The analysis compares four classification algorithms and provides actionable business insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

Business Problem

Challenge: Low conversion rates in telephone marketing campaigns
Goal: Predict which clients will subscribe to term deposits
Impact: Reduce marketing costs and improve campaign efficiency

Key Objectives

Establish Performance Baselines - Define minimum targets our models must beat
Compare Classification Algorithms - Evaluate KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM
Analyze Business Impact - Translate model performance into actionable marketing insights
Provide Implementation Roadmap - Create timeline for model deployment

Dataset Information
